# ClassifyHeartbeats

This project implements the paper "[A deep convolutional neural network model to classify heartbeats](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482517302810?via%3Dihub)" and deploy the model to microcontrollers (based on [TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers)).  
Please refer to the information on the development environment in NOTE.txt. The result of the execution is output by the serial console, as follows:
